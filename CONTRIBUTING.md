# Contributing to vim.kr

## Introduction

We're working on revamping the vim.kr website to not only promote the vim.kr community but also to provide valuable content about Vim editor, its advantages, and tutorials for those eager to learn. We encourage community involvement in this redevelopment.

## How to Contribute

### Participate in Development

- The main development is being led by @devstefancho and @kokoko.kojima. 
- We're adhering to a principle of transparency, so anyone is welcome to contribute to the development.
- Contributions can be made directly to the development or by participating in discussions.

### Join the Discussion

- Discussions regarding the revamp are ongoing in the `homepage-tf` discord forum channel.
- Even if you're not contributing code, you can participate by sharing your ideas and feedback in the channel.
- Key discussion points and decisions will be made by mid-January.

### Direct Commits to Main Branch Prohibited

To maintain the quality of our codebase, direct commits to the `main` branch are not allowed.
We use Husky to enforce this rule. If you try to commit directly to the `main` branch, you'll receive an error message and your commit will be prevented. 
Please create a new branch for your changes and open a pull request for review.
